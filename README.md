# LazyParkingForWindows
This Project is an app that shows parking spaces of a company

The project is written in 2-3 weeks so might be better was written in Java

How to use?

General idea:
An application that you could see on the phone where you can park your vehicle (in closed parking places like at work)
We didnt had the right tools for that, so we did an application for windows but afterwards we did the same application for Android (Another repository) 
there are three users in my app:
Admin hes above everyone else
Operator hes above Driver
And Driver
(all of them have the same password, you can create your own account)

Step 1:
Lunch first ParkingLotServer (you dont have to log in)
if you decide to log in the 
admin can do operation on operator
Username: admin
Password: 123456

as and admin you have the power to shutdown the whole server and remove operators

Step 2:
Lunch ParkingLotClient
From there you can login as Operator or Driver
Driver can only do operation for himself and see where is the space for parking
Operator can create new Drivers do operation on driver and himself
Username: operator / driver
Password: 123456
